### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a work-in-progress front-end developer learning to code at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. I have a background as a UX and digital designer before I started my journey as a front-end developer. My goal is to be able to be hands-on with all phases of a web project. From scope to delivery.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio and front-end studies 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kariann-norheim-1a342862/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I lived in Virginia Beach, USA for four years from 2020 - 2024 --> Returned to Oslo, Norway the summer of '24.
