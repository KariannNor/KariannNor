### Hi there 👋

I am a work-in-progress front-end developer learning to code at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media. I have a background as a UX and digital designer before I started my journey as a front-end developer. My goal is to be able to be hands-on with all phases of a web project. From scope to delivery.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
